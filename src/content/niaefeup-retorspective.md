For the past 4 years, I was a part of NIAEFEUP, an Informatics Students' Branch. In this article I will dive deep on my experience as a Member, Project Manager and Board.
<!-- end_excerpt -->

As my time at Faculdade de Engenharia comes to an end, so does my time at NIAEFEUP. As a software engineer, I am starting to get accustomed to looking back and analyzing past activities or work, as you often do in Agile development. 

This is the retrospective of **my** experience, and I hope it inspires younger peers to follow my steps and join NIAEFEUP --- or any branch, really. For current members, it will probably give you some context and history about NIAEFEUP, which might help you in the future.

## Year 1 (2017-2018)

### Joining NIAEFEUP

As with any story, this one starts with the main subject --- **_myself_** --- entering a different environment which will change the standard course of action. In this case, the environment was NIAEFEUP, and I decided to join as I was starting my second year of University (The recruitment is usually held once every year around October/November).

First, there's an online form you must fill in order to apply, which is then analyzed by the current members. If there are no red flags, an interview is scheduled with the candidate.

> Usually, the open slots are not that limited, so most of the applications are followed up by an interview, so that the members can better assess the candidates' pros and cons. Usually only "troll" applications are discarded.

So there I was, with my first ever "job interview" around the corner. I had to prepare myself.

Now, you must understand two things: 
* The interview is more of a talk with some prepared bullet points for the interviewer, but without the formalities of real job interviews. No one was ever asked to come up with an algorithm to invert a binary tree in O(n) time, nor were they asked any technical question. The interview is purely behavioral (I'll explain why it must be like this later)
* In anything that I'm involved, I try to distinguish myself from the average, by taking a different path, working harder, or a combination of both.

With this in mind, I decided I would demo the side-project I was working on at the time. Surely it would give some advantage, at least it would show that I had some experience and proactivity.

This project was a back-office for managing the weekly menus of a restaurant. It allowed the creation of menus based on pre-loaded meals, which facilitated the process of writing the meal multiple times over the year, and automatically formatted the menu along with the prices. It then allowed the user to generate a printable PDF and in the future it would also allow exporting as image to post on social media!

> As with many side-projects, it never got to see the light of day üò¢

Anyway, the guys at the time seemed to like it, mainly because of the thought I had put into it. It was mobile-friendly and when I told them the tech stack they called me a "brave man".

> The tech stack was HTML, CSS and JS (with a bit of PHP on the side). With no libs, no SASS no nothing. Knowing what I know today, brave would not be the word to describe myself...

I few weeks later I got the email. I was in!

> Fun Fact: Me (and everybody else) also received the "Sorry, you didn't cut it" email that year. It was an interesting experience to find out which of the emails was the one I was supposed to receive, until we got the "Sorry for the mess, if you received the "You're in" email, you are in." email.

Today, I know I didn't need to try so hard and show an actual demo of a side project, but that's a part of me. Nevertheless, here's the first advice:

> Advice #1: In a situation where you are showing why you deserve a position in a team, or company, or whatever... Showing that you can learn, work through difficulties, be proactive goes a long way. This is the type of thing that you don't learn easily, it's more of a personality trait, in my opinion. Experience (or lack thereof) doesn't matter, it's only a matter of time if you have the above traits.

After joining, I've interviewed candidates on 3 "recruitment seasons". Usually there are 2-3 candidates that demo some of their side projects. From my experience, when discussing who's in and who's out, those are the fastest "debates" since there is no discussion. Unanimous *yes*.

This made me happy. To know that what I did is not that common, and to know that it was a positive thing is something to be proud of.

### You're in, now what?

So there I was, among 40-something recently joined members on our "Greeting Meeting", where we learn about what the branch does, how to contribute, and a lot of banter. At the time, there were 3 main things to going on: The NIAEFEUP website, which had recently been revamped, the TTS (TimeTable Selector), widely used by students to preview their schedule and decide which classes to take on the beginning of each term, and the ENEI (The annual national informatics engineering students gathering), that year was our turn, together with the IEEE branch, NIAEFEUP organized ENEI'2018 at FEUP. Since the organization had started on the year prior already, new members could only help as volunteers.

Additionally, there was this event coming up, where High School students would learn about what we do at the Informatics Engineering course. Usually, NIAEFEUP would prepare a small project which would be interesting for a non-programmer to learn about. That year we programmed a Lego EV3 Mindstorms to solve any maze, in real life. We would create the maze by putting boxes on the floor and then the robot inside the path, and it would find the exit every time. 

In short, it would always try to keep a distance to the right wall, and when it could, it would turn right. Eventually this leads to the exit, if you ever need to leave a maze.

This was my first project as a NIAEFEUP member. It did not require a lot of knowledge, it was mostly math, and was very practical, so it was a nice starter, which gave me the experience of working with a team on a project!


### A Plot Twist

When you join a company, you don't expect to be promoted after 6 months. I certainly didn't expect it, but around the time ENEI was being held, it hit us (me and some colleagues from my year): The current board is on their 4th year, they will go out on ERASMUS next year. We won't have a Board next year.

All of this should be fine, since we were only in our 2nd year, the problem was that there was a shortage of 3rd year students on NIAEFEUP at the time, not that they didn't exist, they simply were not around that often.

With this in mind, we decided to create a group and run for the following year's board. We were young and inexperienced, sure, but we had some ideas and we wanted to improve the Branch.

<p align="center" style="font-style:italic">From left to right: Henrique Lima (Global Projects Manager), Me (Global Projects Manager), Duarte Fraz√£o (Enterprise Connections), Rui Alves (Secretary), Miguel Duarte (President). Four more people joined later for Treasury, Image and Branding, Event Planning and Vice-Presidency.</p>

> Fun Fact: This decision was actually taken during ENEI's networking dinner, where students would register in order to be able to talk with company representatives and make contacts. Certainly useful for students ending their studies and looking for jobs. We, on our 2nd year (out of 5) were there as well, for some reason.

We had a new "flagship" project to start, event ideas, and some internal changes we wanted to try and implement in terms of project organization.

The advantage of working with a Students' Branch should be the improvement in organization and manpower, resulting in increased ability to execute and finish large and ambitious projects. 

NIAEFEUP, however, always had a "Give us your project ideas, let's build stuff" mindset internally. While this might be good when there is no planned roadmap, it has some problems as it can "distract" and diverge members, which end up working on multiple smaller projects, often without good planning and discipline. They end up working on "group side-projects", similar to what they would do in the course's classes.

This is one of the things we tried to battle against in our Board Candidacy plan, we wanted projects to have a more disciplined work methodology, in order to reap the benefits of working in a Students' Branch.

Next, we had some big project ideas: **uni** was one of them. It would be the faculty mobile app. To this day the mobile experience --- and to some extent the desktop one as well --- is terrible. Students yearned for an easy way to access simple things like their schedule, bus' schedules, their printing balance, and their tuition fees status. **uni** would be the solution.

Finally, it would be the first year NIAEFEUP would organize Informatics main annual event at FEUP: SINF (Semana de Informatica) --- a week of talks, workshops and networking activities for students, teachers and companies alike. After the success of ENEI, the Faculty's Informatics Department believed we could take on the responsibility, which was previously theirs.

All of this, along with a planned image and brand refresh constituted a plan on all fronts. We believed it was solid.

#### The plot thickens

We were the only group to apply for board for most of the regulated period, until on the last day, another application showed up. Who could it be? The 5th year students would leave university next year, the 4th year students would go on ERASMUS next year and wouldn't be around, the 1st year students were not enough. Remember the 3rd year students that were not around that often? They were back, to take what was *rightfully* theirs.

Let's just say their candidacy plan looked oddly similar to ours (that was the last year that Board applications were public during the application period).

We prepared for the debate, in order to discuss both plans and held it with all members present. It was really fun and different from what you'd expect to do in an Informatics Students' Branch.

After the voting, we won and were appointed the new Board of NIAEFEUP for 2018-2019. 

As a Global Project Manager, I'd be responsible for overseeing NIAEFEUP's projects on a high level, as well as guiding at least one of the Branch's projects.

<p align="center" style="font-style:italic">Our Kanban Board</p>


Apart from a DIY Kanban Board for our projects, not much happened until the holiday season, as this took place almost at the end of the semester, which leads us to **Year 2**.

## Year 2 (2018-2019)

September again, after my first Summer Internship I was ready to go at it again. 

The first two challenges were the SINF --- Yep, the full-week event we inherited was about to have its first edition under NIAEFEUP's organization --- and the recruitment process.

The latter had been one of the pain points of the Board each year --- *remember when I received both the "You're in" and "You're out" emails regarding my application?* Well, most of the process was manual, and still is to some extent, but I wanted to improve it and decided to implement some helping functionality to our website, allowing us to better control our recruitment seasons, by storing the applications, as well as the questions asked that year on interviews. Most importantly, it allowed us to automatically approve, reject batches of candidates instead of manually copy/pasting the relevant emails. Interview scheduling is still TBD.

At that Summer Internship I had discovered this new amazing thing called React which, together with Node.js made up the base of our project's tech stack.

This was when the **NIJobs** idea surfaced, I wanted to apply this new knowledge in a NIAEFEUP project, as it was becoming very popular, and I believed it would benefit its members very much to gain experience with it.

**NIJobs** would be a web application for students to have an easy way of checking companies' offers (full-time work, internships, research grants, etc...), while at the same time providing companies with a more direct way to reach university students. We are always receiving emails from companies and organizations asking us to share opportunities, but we cannot do it every time, otherwise we would be marked as Spam, and nobody would read it anyway. **NIJobs** would be the solution.

This, together with **uni**, had a specific general student problem to solve, they had potential to grow over time (both could be extended to other courses and faculties, for example), fulfilling our informal slogan: *"From students, to students."*

We now had 2 new "flagship" projects in mind. For many years, the good old [TimeTable Selector](https://ni.fe.up.pt/tts) was our most famous product. Now, it was time we would give it some company.

So we started both projects. One was Mobile, another was a Web Application. From the beginning I decided this NIJobs would have a "3rd customer".

Apart from benefiting companies and students, it should benefit NIAEFEUP members by being a source of knowledge and good practices, and until today, multiple projects (for our course and others) have been bootstrapped by cloning NIJobs repository, which makes me proud.

<p align="center" style="font-style:italic">The first mockup of NIJobs Homepage</p>

In the beginning, a lot of people were excited to work on it, but eventually it was me and a couple more. It was the first time I was managing, or at least *guiding* a project this big and clearly I was not able to keep my workforce. It was nothing special, eventually people just naturally lost interest due to the lack of "goal accomplishments".

I believe that when starting a big project, you won't see the effects of your work in practice right away, as if it were an object abiding to Newton's first law. It takes a lot more effort to make something move when it is stopped than if it wore already moving.

This, along with the fact that I strived for attention to detail, meant that the project would start slowly. I was aware of this and called it an investment. I didn't want to create a project that had to be rebuilt or was really hard to contribute to just after I left. This priority in quality over time was important for me.

Parallel to this was the development of **uni**. They followed a different strategy. I don't want to sound jealous --- and I'm not, quite the opposite, actually --- but the truth is that they cut some corners in the beginning in order to move faster, which is fine. Apart from this they also had a more strict development workflow (they had weekly meetings, for example).

I didn't do that on NIJobs, maybe if I had, people wouldn't be so demotivated/uninterested, who knows...

By the end of this year, a new election period took place, and we were re-elected, as the only candidates. We had to keep up the work.

Yes... Work...

## Year 3 (2019-2020)

This was a great year for **uni**. It was the year when we released the first version on Google Play Store! Students found it very helpful!

**NIJobs** was not looking that good. From the new rookies that entered NIAEFEUP that year, no one joined the project üò¢. I kept pushing --- as I had been doing since the beginning. After my second Summer Internship, I gained a lot of web knowledge and the experience I gained working on NIJobs helped me do some things there as well, so I knew this was positive, and it would eventually pay off.

This was the time I felt we needed ***A Real Manager‚Ñ¢***. We needed new "talent" and people with motivation to work on this project, and I was not that. I was more of a technical guide, if you will. I'd learned about how Agile Methodologies help productivity and all that, but it just doesn't work in a Students Branch where people are not paid.

We rely solely on people's goodwill and individual motivation. We cannot expect people to come for meetings and stay focused just because. I personally just kept working on it due to the internal satisfaction it gave me from learning a lot of new things and solving different challenges. Every person is different, and that year, people were not inclined to Web Development it seems.

Some things needed to change, I needed to gather a new work group from the next Rookies on the following year...

## Year 4 (2020-today)
Skipping the whole COVID-19 thing, which obviously constituted a big change in our workflow --- we were unable to use our office and needed to go remote --- a new Board was in town. However, I'd keep my place as Project Manager of **NIJobs**, which in practice involves more work than the Global Project Manager role, since it targets the actual work of a project, on a lower level.

I developed a strategy to "capture" new talent to help me on **NIJobs**. Since I would target Rookies, which would be younger and with less experience, I knew they would feel they wouldn't have the required experience to help, so I suggested that the more experienced members should do a set of workshops on the technologies we use, in order to give younger folks some context and encourage them to start contributing to our projects right away. We held workshops on Git, Docker, Node.js+HTTP, React+JavaScript and Flutter.

Apart from this, I started doing weekly meetings to share dev experience and progress. With this, I wanted new people to have context about the projects structure and current issues, while at the same time promoting a routine of contribution and sense of responsibility among the members. So far, it worked which makes me regret I haven't done it sooner. You live and you learn...

This is one of the reasons interviews at NIAEFEUP --- and at other Student Branches --- must be behavioral. It doesn't matter that people can code, it matters that they ***will*** code. As I've verified, as long as people are motivated and eager to learn and contribute, experience won't be a blocker. Older members should always try to pass on the knowledge for younger ones so that the wheel keeps on turning. I certainly am trying to do it.
